Will download chapters of manga from Mangastream. Only tested on One Piece, but should work for other manga on MangaStream.

Let's say we want to download the latest chapter of One Piece (799). I'll go to the url http://readms.com/r/one_piece/799/2920/1, and run the following

./dlmanga.py http://readms.com/r/one_piece/799/2920/1

Which will download the pngs in the directory one_piece/799
